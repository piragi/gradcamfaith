For a personal project, I try to measure the impact of SAE features that we gathered from the residual stream and want to see how much impact it has on the final classification. Also, we want to measure if the patches where the features turn up have high gradients in the attention maps. The goal is to then later identify features that have high impact on the final classification but are not really flagged by the attention mechanism. With the identified features, I then boost the token positions at the specific layer when doing attribution generation with Chefer's method.
My first hypothesis is, that we should be able to identify features that have a low gradient (and hence would not be considered by Chefer's method) at the attention map but have a high activation at the residual stream. Maybe, there is a similar effect as in the steering paper, that using a specific subset of features could improve the attribution map. In the steering paper, they found that a specific subset (approximately 10%) are highly steerable.
In current findings from my project, I have found a positive correlation between a subset of features and their attribution strength. Meaning, I was able to identify a subset of features that have a high steerability towards the target class and that also light up in current attribution methods. This would strengthen my assumption, that some features have spatial properties.
